      Google suggests 75 percentile

    <Notes>
      This is LCP results for the same website, period of time and device. See
      how different the numbers are although they reflect the same situation.
      The average is not a good measurement of the tendency. One single user
      with an unusually slow device and network can push the number up. Median
      is a better metric because it tells us how fast the page is for 50% of our
      users. However, fast page speed results for only half of users isnâ€™t
      really a good result. That is why a percentile is a better choice. That
      shows us how fast the page is for 75 percent of our users or 95 percent of
      users. So it is always better to use a percentile in the calculation of
      web performance metrics. Google suggests using 75 percentile.
